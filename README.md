Week 1 Challenge

For this challenge we were given starter code and we had to refactor the index.html and style.css files. 

The first thing I fixed was in the index.html. There was no id set for search engine optimization. So i set an id="search-engine-optimization" so when you clicked that id in the header, you were taken there on the webpage.
The second thing i completed was adding semantic elemnts to the html. I added header, footer, and section. Next I added nave to header and css sinced i removed the div from the header. Next i removed classes that we no longer needed in the css. I also added notes to the html. 
Next time i did was removed footer class from css and added the article to the html to replace another div.  
I then removed classed for the content in html (search engine optimization, online rep mang, and social media marketing). I removed a lot of repititive css and just used article instead. I did the same thing for section img and section h2.
I then added alt to images and left blank per no importance.
Next i reduced the benefits css just i did for the contents css. I reduced them to .beenifts div, beneifts h3, and benefits img. There was a lot of repitition so this was easy to combine instead. 
After that i added alt attibutes to the content images. 
I reorganized the css file to follow semantic structure and left comments in that css file.
